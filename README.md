# SDLCProgram-AlecAndAustin
This program is designed to allow a user to educate themselves in regards to, or review, topics relating to the Software Development Life Cycle. It has two interfaces; one of which being a Study Guide that allows the selection of a category, and displays the corresponding information.  The other interface consists of an interactive multiple-choice quiz based on the information in the Study Guide, giving feedback of the correct answer when the user is incorrect, and displaying a final grade on the quiz when the ten questions are answered.  The questions and notes are read from data files to which more content can be added without jeopardizing the program.
